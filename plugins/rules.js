üèÆ *BOT RULES*
‚ò†Ô∏è Welcome here are rules from Legend_hacke bot team ‚ò†Ô∏è

‚ò†Ô∏è _Do not call bot, if you do then you'll get automatically blocked by bot._
    
‚ò†Ô∏è _Do not spam bot with commands, if bot is not responding then it means either bot is off or there's internet issue at owner's end._
    
‚ò†Ô∏è _Do not abuse/disrespect bot and its owner._
    
‚ò†Ô∏è _If you see any bug/error in bot then report it to owner with the command !bug/report <problem>._
    
‚ò†Ô∏è _If you want this bot in your group then contact owner by typing !owner/creator._
    
‚ò†Ô∏è _Enjoy the bot and have fun._
Special dedication from Kanambo and Aditya
